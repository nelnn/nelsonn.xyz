I went to visit Jake up North the last weekend and he decided we should climb Tryfan. It took us two hours of driving to get there in the Saturday morning and arrived at 10-ish. The weather wasn't the nicest but the hike shouldn't be too hard right? After all I bought a pair of Goretex Boots which cost Â£100 and felt prepared. And boy I was wrong.

Less than 30 minutes in I started to doubt whether I could get to the summit. I was gased and had to stop frequently to catch my breath. The path was nowhere as hard as what was coming next, but for the pace we ascend I ran out of oxygen very quickly. My heart rate was probably over 180 during this period.

After awhile my heart rate settled down and the rest of the hike I didn't feel too tired whilst the climb was more challenging.
