It shows how sophisticated a relationship can be. The word marriage literally means they are binded to a certain lifestyle for the rest of their lives, even when both parties wanting to get out of this toxix, hypocritical situation. However, for some reason they choose to not leave each other and like they enjoy the infinite torture. This shows that human is sociopathic to some extent, and the cause may well be  
the parents.


It is quite funnt to see how the movie potraits the media. They can easily manipulate the public by making up any story.
